#### What this backend will solve
This backend system addresses the major concerns of data management and security. It also provides scalability which solves the future problem of handling a growing user base and their large amounts of data.

#### User benefits
This system will provide an enhanced user experience as the database can store the user's favourite locations that can be presented upon request. Due to the implementation of authentication and authorisation on every request, the user's personal information and preferences are kept secure. The system store's its contents in the cloud, and thus user's can expect minimal downtime along with fast response times that lead to a better user experience.

The impact of this backend may extend to future additions of the application that are merely an extension of the robust backend's existing capabilities.
